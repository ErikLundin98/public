# Erik Lundin's projects

A collection of some of my hobby projects.


## Deep Snake

In this project I used TensorFlow to create and train deep neural networks for playing snake. See the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/ErikLundin98/public/blob/main/deep_snake/deep_snake.ipynb) for demonstrations of the final result and some information about how I did it.

## Genre Guessing in R

As a way to learn how to implement machine learning models in R, I created a custom ensemble classifier which predicts song genre based on audio features such as average beats per minute, frequency and other more complicated measurements. See the [R markdown file](https://github.com/ErikLundin98/public/blob/main/genre_guesser/genreguesser.md) for a more detailed report of the classifier and procedure.
