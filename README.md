# Erik Lundin's projects

A collection of some of my hobby projects.


## Deep Snake

In this project I used TensorFlow to create and teach deep neural networks to play snake. See the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/ErikLundin98/public/blob/main/deep_snake/deep_snake.ipynb) for demonstrations of the final result and some information about how I did it.

The code can be found in [`deep_snake/`](https://github.com/ErikLundin98/public/tree/main/deep_snake)

## Genre Guessing in R

As a way to learn how to implement machine learning models in R, I created a custom ensemble classifier which predicts song genre based on audio features such as average beats per minute, frequency and other more complicated measurements. See the [R Markdown File](https://github.com/ErikLundin98/public/blob/main/genre_guesser/genreguesser.md) for a more detailed report of the classifier and procedure.

The code can be found in [`genre_guesser/`](https://github.com/ErikLundin98/public/tree/main/genre_guesser)
